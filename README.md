Some simple Packer templates for CentOS (relatively well maintained) and Debian (not so well maintained). All of them
are for Virtualbox only.

For CentOS there are two versions:

 - minimal: I try not to include anything that is not strictly needed here
 - standard: Has stuff like vim, wget and Java installed

> **NOTE:** None of the two include Chef or Puppet but both have the Guest Additions.
